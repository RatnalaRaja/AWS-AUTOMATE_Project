## Introduction

Sending emails programmatically can be a crucial part of various applications and workflows. This repository aims to simplify the process by utilizing AWS services like Amazon SES (Simple Email Service) and Lambda to automate email sending. Whether you want to send notifications, alerts, or reports via email, this project provides a foundation for you to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
- AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS credentials.
- Basic knowledge of AWS services like SES, Lambda, and IAM.
- Python and required dependencies if you plan to use Python scripts.

## Setup
